**ReSTful API:**
- API that use HTTP request to get, create, update, or delete data from server to client.

**Closure**
- A function inside another function that can have access to variables declared from the outer functions
- Closure can update the outer variables

**Hoisting**
- Variables are in scope of the closest outer function, NOT in scope of the block.  
Ex: If we declare a variable inside for loop, it is not in scope of that for only,
it is still in scope the the function that contains the for loop.
- Re-define the variable in different blocks inside the same function is the same as
re-assigning same variable with new value in a function.
