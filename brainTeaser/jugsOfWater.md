**Question:**  
You have a five-quart jug, a three-quart jug, and an unlimited supply of water (but no measureing cups). How would you come up with exactly four quarts of water?
Note that the jugs are oddly shaped, such that filling up exactly "half" of the jug would be impossible.

**Answer:**  
1. Fill up 3 quart jug, then put that amount of water into 5 quart jug. Now you have 3 quart of water inside 5 quart jug
2. Fill up 3 quart jug again, then put that amount of water into 5 quart jug until the 5 quart jug is full. Now you have 5 quart of water in 5 quart jug, and you also have 1 quart of water remained in the 3 quart jug.
3. Empty the 5 quart of water inside the 5 quart jug, then put 1 quart of quarter from 3 quart jug into 5 quart jug. Now you have 1 quart of water in the 5 quart jug.
4. Fill up the 3 quart jug, then put that amount of water into 5 quart jug. Now you have 4 quarts of water in the 5 quart jug.
