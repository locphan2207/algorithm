**Question:**  
There is an island that has many people. Some people have blue eyes. One day, there is an order that all blue eye people must leave. There is a boat everyday to take blue eye people out of the island. However, they don't know their own eye colors, but they can see other people eye color.
They know there is at least 1 blue eye person, but they don't know how many blue eye people exactly. They only leave the island when they are sure that they have blue eyes. Otherwise, they will stay until they figure out.  
How many days would it take to make all blue eye people leave the island?

**Answer:**  
- Let's assume there is **one** person with blue eye. On the first day, he looks at other people eyes, and realizes no-one has blue eye, so he believes he is the only one that has blue eye. He has to leave on that day.  
-> It takes **1 day** for all blue eye people to leave.  

- Let's assume there is **two** people with blue eye. On the first day, each blue eye person will look at others, and realize there is one person with blue eye. He or she knows for sure there is one or two blue blue eye people including them. Yet, he or she is not sure if he or she also has blue eyes or not. So each person doesn't leave on the first day. They wait until next day. On the next day, they see each other again and realize that blue eye person is still here. So he or she knows that the blue eye person has the same thought as them. In other words, both blue eye people see each other have blue eyes, they are both not sure, and both wait until the second day. But now they realize they both have blue eyes, and now they have to leave on that second day.  
-> It takes them **2 days** to leave the island.  

- Let's assume there is **n** people with blue eyes. They will see the same n-1 blue eye people for n days to realize that they are also a blue eye one. So they will all together leave on that day.  
-> It takes them **n days** to leave.
